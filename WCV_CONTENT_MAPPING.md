## 📖 Vision Statement (Full Translation)

WCV's vision rests on a profound and universal aspiration: **to build a world where every human being has the opportunity to live in peace, with dignity and equity**, regardless of their origin, gender, or social condition.

We dream of a future where:
- **Social justice** is not a demand but a daily reality
- **Equality** between women and men, girls and boys, is not an exception but the norm
- **Women** are not relegated to the margins but are fully active in development, governance, economy, and community life
- **Children** are protected, educated, valued, and heard

This vision was born from our commitment in the field. It has been built through the life stories, struggles, and hopes of the women and children we accompany every day. It guides us in every initiative, every action, every collaboration.

### Our Vision for Peace
We do not conceive of peace solely as the absence of conflict, but as **a living balance based on the recognition of each person, mutual respect, solidarity, and inclusion**.

In a country still marked by:
- Recurring armed conflicts
- Sexual violence used as a weapon of war
- Population displacements
- Extreme poverty

**Peace becomes more than an ideal—it is a vital urgency.**

For WCV, peace begins in hearts, families, and communities. It takes root in:
- Homes where domestic violence is fought
- Schools where children learn to live together
- Neighborhoods where women are respected and protected

### Our Vision for Social Justice
The DRC is a country of immense resources, but where wealth benefits only a minority. Inequalities are glaring, especially for women and children, often left behind in access to education, health, justice, and employment.

We want a Congo where social justice becomes a lived reality:
- Where women have genuine access to land, training, and entrepreneurship
- Where girls are no longer married early, but educated and valued
- Where displaced children, orphans, or street children find their place in society

### Our Vision for Gender Equality
In the Congolese context, equal opportunities remain a major challenge, as stereotypes are deeply rooted in mentalities, cultural practices, and sometimes even in public policies.

Our vision is clear:
- A Congo where women participate in decisions that concern them
- A Congo where girls are not judged incapable but supported as future leaders
- A Congo where boys are also educated to respect, cooperate, and share responsibilities

This requires fundamental work: **changing mentalities, transforming institutions, reforming laws**, and above all, valuing concrete actions that promote this equality on the ground.

## 🎯 Mission Statement (Full Translation)

At WCV (Women and Children's Voice), **our mission is not just words—it is embodied in daily, concrete commitment**: to accompany, promote, and value the efforts of women and children to build a more equitable, stronger, and more humane society.

### Our Core Mission
**To support, strategically and financially, women's groups and children's structures in their struggle for empowerment and equality of gender-related rights.**

### Supporting Women's Groups

Throughout the Democratic Republic of Congo, women fight every day to support their families, their communities, and their dreams, often in extremely difficult conditions. These women carry courageous initiatives:
- Small agricultural cooperatives
- Savings groups
- Sewing workshops
- Training structures
- Awareness networks

**At WCV, we see these women as the true actors of development.**

Our mission is to accompany them strategically by:
- Strengthening their capacities
- Facilitating their access to financing
- Offering them management, communication, and leadership tools

We provide them with **financial support, but also human and organizational support**, because we know that a well-structured and well-supported group can become an engine of social transformation.

### Supporting Children's Structures

Our mission also extends to structures that care for children, particularly those that welcome:
- Street children
- Orphans
- Displaced children
- Children from disadvantaged families

In a country where access to education remains a major challenge, where thousands of children live without protection or guidance, we act to ensure that **every child has the right to a dignified, secure childhood filled with hope**.

This means:
- Supporting reception centers and community schools
- Equipping educators who work with dedication, often without means
- Developing literacy, nutrition, and rights awareness programs
- Creating safe environments where children can learn, play, dream, and heal

### Focus on Empowerment

Empowerment is at the heart of our mission. For us, this means giving everyone—and especially women and children—**the means to take control of their future, make their voices heard, and actively participate in social, economic, and political life**.

This happens through access to:
- Basic and professional education
- Civic and legal rights
- Health, including reproductive health
- Economic resources (microcredits, training, support)

**We believe that an empowered woman means a stable family, a stronger community, and a more resilient nation.**

### Impact Statistics (from website)
- **1,500+** Women empowered through microfinance programs
- **800+** Children receiving scholarships
- **600+** Violence victims supported psychologically and legally
- **10,000+** Participants in 200+ educational workshops across DRC
