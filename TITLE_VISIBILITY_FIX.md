# Color Visibility Fix

## Changes Applied
- **Geographic Reach Section**: Removed `dark:` modifiers and enforced the dark theme styles (neutral-900 background, white text, neutral-800 cards) permanently.
- **Mission Section**: Verified that this section was already using static dark styles (`bg-neutral-900`, `text-white`), ensuring consistency.

## Result
Both the "Mission" and "Geographic Reach" sections will now appear in their "Dark Mode" style regardless of the user's system theme preference.
